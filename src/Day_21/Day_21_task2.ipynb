    "Supervised Learning Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the data already has labels or correct answers. The model learns from input-output examples and tries to predict the correct output for new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised Learning is used when the data has no labels or answers. \n",
    "The model tries to find hidden patterns, similarities, or clusters in the data by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement Learning is where a system learns by trial and error.\n",
    "It receives rewards for correct actions and penalties for wrong actions, and improves over time.\n",
