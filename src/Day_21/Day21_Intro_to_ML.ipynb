    "Machine Learning is a way of teaching computers to learn from data instead of programming them with fixed rules. \n",
    "In traditional programming, we give the computer clear instructions and data to get the result. \n",
    "But in Machine Learning, we provide examples of data along with the correct answers, and the system automatically finds patterns and learns the rules on its own.\n",
    "Once trained, it can use those learned patterns to make predictions or decisions on new data."
